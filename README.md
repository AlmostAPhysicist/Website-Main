I'm planning to create a website under my domain: [almostaphysicist.com](https://almostaphysicist.com).

## Site Structure

- **Main Page:** My basic info and highlights.
- **Portfolio Page**
- **Blog Page**
- **Notes Page:** (A digital garden, inspired by Obsidian)
- **Workshop:** (A place for cool experiments and ideas.)

### Navigation

- The main page should link to all other pages.
- Every page will have my logo at the top, which links back to the main page.

### Subdomain Setup

- Subdomains like the blog should be accessible at both `almostaphysicist.com/blog` and the primary address: `blog.almostaphysicist.com`.
- Is it possible to set this up using aliases or similar features?

### Domain & Subdomain Management

- How can I configure this on Porkbun?
- I want similar subdomain setups for the other sections too.

### Project Structure

- Each section (main site, blog, portfolio, etc.) will be a separate project on GitHub.
- On the main website, as an example, the blog page will give an overview and highlights, then link out to the full blog site.

Any advice or tips on structuring this, especially with domains, subdomains, and independent GitHub projects, would be appreciated!
